If you are accessing or using the CueRide Platform to access or use CueRide Business services on behalf of an organization contracted with CueRide, and you are not accessing or using the CueRide Platform as a Rider or Driver, your access and use is governed by the contract between CueRide and your organization.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">When using the CueRide Platform, you also agree to conduct yourself in accordance with our , which shall form part of this Agreement between you and CueRide.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The CueRide Platform</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The CueRide Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other individuals, excluding any Excluded Individuals, using the CueRide Platform are collectively referred to herein as “Users.” The driving services provided (a) by Drivers to Riders (including other transportation related services provided by Drivers), or (b) by means of autonomous vehicles (“Autonomous Vehicles” or “AVs”), in connection with the CueRide Platform, shall collectively be referred to herein as “Rideshare Services” and the providers thereof “Rideshare Providers.” “CueRide Services” shall include any service provided by CueRide pursuant to the CueRide Platform (for clarity, CueRide Services does not include Rideshare Services or Third-Party Services). As a User, you authorize CueRide to match and/or re-match you with Drivers or Riders or AVs based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, applicable vehicle requirements, membership status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the same or other considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders when the Rider accepts the offered Rideshare Services. As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means any individual who is registering to use the CueRide Platform or whose use of the CueRide Platform is on behalf of an organization contracted with CueRide, except as a Rider or Driver.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent transportation modalities (e.g., bikes, scooters, cars, etc.) or be offered other services through the CueRide Platform. In some markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned and operated by CueRide. In other markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned or operated by third parties.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">In any case, your use of CueRide Services through the CueRide Platform may be subject to additional agreements between you and CueRide as applicable to the particular service in the particular market (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE LYFT SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless such Supplemental Agreement specifically states otherwise.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Modification to the Agreement</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">CueRide reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including by changing or deleting existing terms or by adding new ones, and such modifications shall be binding on you upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the CueRide Platform after modifications to this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such modifications. Drivers or driver applicants, however, may opt out of revisions to the Agreement’s arbitration provisions with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17 below. CueRide reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the CueRide Platform after modifications to any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such modifications.</p><p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Effective Date: May 30, 2025</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Eligibility</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The CueRide Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement and are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations herein. The CueRide Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not use your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by CueRide. To use the CueRide Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create one User account, and CueRide reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate accounts. Your participation in certain CueRide programs and use of certain CueRide services may be subject to additional eligibility requirements as determined by CueRide.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of a 16 or 17-year old minor you may create a User account for such minor to use the CueRide Platform subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor’s use of the CueRide Platform is limited solely to accessing and using CueRide Services and/or Third-Party Services where expressly permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such CueRide Services and/or Third-Party Services, (b) you determine that the CueRide Services and/or Third-Party Services are suitable for the minor, (c) you ensure that the minor’s use of the CueRide Platform and applicable CueRide Services and/or Third-Party Services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable Supplemental Agreements, and the CueRide Platform, (d) you ensure that the minor does not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an authorized guardian, and (e) you explain the terms of this Agreement to the minor. For clarity, no unaccompanied User under 18 years old may ride in an Autonomous Vehicle.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">By creating a User account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to the Agreement on the minor’s behalf, you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance, and your own acceptance, of the terms of this Agreement, and you shall assume any and all responsibility and liability for the minor’s use of the CueRide Platform as provided by the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Charges</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services, CueRide Services, or Third-Party Services may result in charges (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if applicable. Charges to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes, including as set forth on your market’s  (“CueRide Cities Page”), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. CueRide has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s CueRide Cities Page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your market’s CueRide Cities Page or within the CueRide Platform. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable CueRide Cities Page or price quote within the CueRide Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”). There are two types of Fares, quoted and variable.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Quoted Fares. When you make a ride request using the CueRide Platform, CueRide will quote you a Fare at the time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is confirmed. If your final destination is not the same as the destination in your ride request, or the time and/or distance of your ride differs substantially from your quoted fare, or if you attempt to abuse the CueRide Platform, we may, at CueRide’s sole discretion and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare as described below. CueRide does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the same ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Variable Fares. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental charges based on the time and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Rideshare Provider’s device to calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride. In addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Service Fee. CueRide may charge a “Service Fee” for each ride, as set forth on the applicable CueRide Cities Page.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Prime Time. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare Services (“Prime Time”), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted fares, we may factor Prime Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Priority Pickup and Wait &amp; Save. In some cases, you may be able to select an expected pick up that is faster or slower than standard for a higher or lower Fare, respectively.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Cancellation Fee. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the CueRide Platform, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. CueRide may also charge a fee if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help Center to learn more about .</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Damage Fee. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by CueRide in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. CueRide reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Abuse Fee. If we receive a credible report that you have misused or abused the CueRide Platform, you agree to pay an “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by CueRide in its sole discretion. CueRide reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of abuse prior to processing the Abuse Fee.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Tolls. In some instances tolls, toll estimates, and/or return tolls may apply to your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s CueRide Cities Page for more information about toll charges. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by CueRide will match the toll charged to the Rideshare Provider, if any.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Other Charges. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including but not limited to: actual or anticipated airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees, fuel surcharges, wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by CueRide or its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law CueRide will collect applicable taxes. See your market’s CueRide Cities Page for information on other Charges that may apply to your ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Tips. Following a ride, you may have the opportunity to elect to tip your Driver in cash or through the CueRide Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the CueRide Platform. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Charges Generally.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Facilitation of Charges. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processor (First Data, Stripe, Inc., Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc., etc.). CueRide may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. With the exception of tips and the purchase of CueRide Cash, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless expressly permitted by CueRide. Your payment of Charges to CueRide satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the CueRide Platform, CueRide Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment frequency indicated in your settings. If your primary payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then you agree that CueRide may charge your other available payment methods in the CueRide Platform. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">No Refunds. All Charges are non-refundable except to the extent required by law. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the CueRide Platform, any disruption to the CueRide Platform, CueRide Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Coupons. You may receive coupons, credits, discounts, or other promotions (collectively, “Coupons”) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Coupons are valid only for use on the CueRide Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise, and if the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable Coupon value, we may charge your payment method on file for the Charges in excess of the Coupon amount. With respect to Fares, CueRide may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the Coupon. Additional restrictions on Coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant Coupon within the Rewards section of the CueRide Platform.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Supplemental Charges. Charges related to CueRide Services (including the rental of bikes and scooters) may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental Agreement.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Third-Party Charges. If you choose to purchase Third-Party Services (described further in Section 21) through the CueRide Platform, you authorize your payment method on file to be charged according to the pricing terms set by CueRide or the third-party provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the purchased services.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Payment Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each request for CueRide Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services, CueRide may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge; however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. CueRide is not responsible for these charges and is unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to learn more about .</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">For clarity, CueRide does not charge a fee for Users to access the CueRide Platform, but retains the right to charge Users and/or organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for accessing or using CueRide Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services made available through the CueRide Platform.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Driver Payments</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If you are a Driver, you will receive payment for your provision of Rideshare Services pursuant to the terms of the , which shall form part of this Agreement between you and CueRide.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">CueRide Communications</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">By entering into this Agreement or using the CueRide Platform, you agree to receive communications from us, our affiliates, or our third-party partners, at any of the phone numbers provided to CueRide by you or on your behalf, and also via emails, text messages, calls, and push notifications at any time (including between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., local time).

If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims or portions of Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims or portions of such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims or portions of Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims or portions of Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims or portions of Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims or portions of Claims in arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(d) Pre-Arbitration Process.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">A party who intends to initiate arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the factual and legal nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific relief sought; and (3) include the name, mailing and email addresses, and phone number of the party sending the Notice.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Your Notice to CueRide must be personally signed by you (and by your attorney if you are represented by counsel).

CueRide’s notice to you will be sent by email to the most recent contact information that you have provided to CueRide.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Whoever sends the Notice must give the other party 60 days from receipt of the complete Notice (including the Authentication and Consent, if required) to investigate the claim before commencing an arbitration. The submission of a complete Notice will toll any applicable statute of limitations or other limitations period for the claims and requested relief in the Notice until 60 days from when the other party receives the Notice of Dispute.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This Pre-Arbitration Process is essential so that you and CueRide have a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or assessment or collection of any arbitration fees in connection with such an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the American Arbitration Association (or any other arbitration provider selected by the parties) may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed. If a process arbitrator has been appointed at the request of a party, the process arbitrator also has the same authority as a court to enforce the requirement that arbitration not be commenced until the requirements of this Section 17(d) have been satisfied.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(e) Rules Governing the Arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its , and, if applicable, its Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of the AAA rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event, unless you and CueRide agree otherwise, shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration administrator, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written agreement. If the AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, you and CueRide will select another arbitration provider, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written agreement. If there is no agreement, a court will do so.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">As part of the arbitration, both you and CueRide will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. Except as specified in subsections (b) and (c) above, the arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different Riders or Drivers. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(f) Arbitration Fees and Awards.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modifications:</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If CueRide initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, CueRide will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">With respect to any Claims brought by CueRide against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a Driver against CueRide that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between CueRide and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, CueRide’s actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by CueRide to deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, CueRide’s actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with CueRide under the termination provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by CueRide to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including CueRide’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by CueRide to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other CueRide promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), CueRide shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by CueRide pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (f)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(f)(2), the term “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Unless applicable law provides otherwise, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an arbitrator may award costs as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents (which the parties agree shall apply in arbitration).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Although under some laws CueRide may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, CueRide agrees that it will not seek such an award from you unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined that you or your counsel have violated the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), which the parties agree shall be applicable in arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of CueRide’s last written settlement offer made after you fully complied with the Pre-Arbitration Process described in subsection (d) above, then CueRide will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater. In determining whether you are entitled to the minimum $1,000 payment, the arbitrator shall not consider amounts offered or awarded for attorneys’ fees or costs.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(g) Location and Manner of Arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Unless you and CueRide agree otherwise, the arbitration hearing, if any, between CueRide and a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address or by videoconference, and the arbitration hearing, if any, between CueRide and a Driver will take place in the county in which the Driver provides Rideshare Services or by videoconference. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for an AAA arbitration. Your right to the hearing and the format of the hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. You and CueRide agree that you and a CueRide representative will personally appear (which can include appearance by videoconference) at the hearing (along with your and CueRide’s respective legal counsel, if the parties are represented by counsel).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(h) Additional Procedures for Coordinated Claims.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are submitted simultaneously), the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, shall apply, and all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in stages using bellwether proceedings if they are not resolved during the Pre-Arbitration Process. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, each side shall select up to 20 cases (40 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. The cases shall be resolved individually by different arbitrators to the extent that the AAA has a sufficient number of arbitrators available. If the AAA does not have a sufficient number of available arbitrators to decide all of the cases filed, the AAA may assign multiple cases to the same arbitrator, but the arbitrator must still resolve each case individually. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept, administer, or demand payment of fees for arbitrations commenced in violation of this subsection 17(h).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and CueRide will pay the mediation fee. The parties shall attempt to reach agreement on a mutually agreeable mediator. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, AAA will oversee a rank and strike process with the parties and, if no agreeable mediator is chosen, AAA may administratively appoint a mediator. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage of bellwether proceedings, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved, except that in the second and later stages each side shall select up to 50 cases (100 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. Between stages, counsel for the parties shall meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the staged proceedings, including whether to further increase the number of cases filed in each stage.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If this subsection 17(h) applies to a Notice, the statute of limitations applicable to the claims and relief set forth in that Notice shall be tolled from the date the Notice is sent until that Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have authority to enforce this subsection 17(h), including to enjoin the filing, assessing or demanding fees for, administration of, or prosecution of arbitrations. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in San Francisco County, California, to enforce this subsection 17(h). Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if either party requests appointment of a process arbitrator, a process arbitrator may decide issues relating to compliance with the requirements of subsection 17(d) above or this subsection 17(h), or the issues that a process arbitrator may decide under Rule MA-6 of the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This subsection 17(h) and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of this Arbitration Agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the staging process in this subsection 17(h) is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(i) Exceptions to Arbitration.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection with the use of the CueRide Platform, CueRide Services, or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are brought in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with Section 18, CueRide will not require arbitration of those claims. CueRide’s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or controversy.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Agreement or settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Agreement if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(j) Severability.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Except as otherwise provided in the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(k) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(l) Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not in a Pending Settlement Action.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims defined in Section 17(f)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(k) above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in CueRide’s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with CueRide. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying CueRide in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Cases have been filed against CueRide and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against CueRide alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with CueRide under this Arbitration Agreement, you are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against CueRide in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">(m) Binding Effect; Third-Party Beneficiaries.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or against any third parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and permitted assigns, where their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to your use of the CueRide Platform, CueRide Services, or Rideshare Services. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Choice of Forum and Class-Action and Coordinated-Action Waiver for Non-Arbitrated Claims</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Claims (1) excepted from arbitration by, and brought consistent with, Section 17(i) or (2) otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be subject to arbitration, shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts in the state in which the incident or accident underlying the plaintiff's claim(s) occurred, notwithstanding that other courts may have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims or personal jurisdiction over the parties.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If for any reason claims do not proceed in arbitration, such claims may be brought and litigated on an individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or representative action against CueRide, or otherwise seek to include your claims or case in a pending class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or representative action against CueRide. No action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in any fashion with any other proceeding, except that the parties may agree to participate in a class-wide settlement. The interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to choice of law principles, and by any applicable federal law. If Delaware law is inapplicable for any reason, then the interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall be governed by the law of the state where the court of competent jurisdiction deciding the claims is located. If there is a final judicial determination that any part of this paragraph is unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful portion shall be severed and severance shall have no effect whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of any other part of this Agreement, including without limitation the choice-of-forum provision in the preceding paragraph.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Confidentiality</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential information relating to CueRide’s business, operations and properties, information about a User made available to you in connection with such User’s use of the CueRide Platform, which may include the User’s name, pick-up location, contact information and photo (“Confidential Information”) disclosed to you by CueRide for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties, and you agree not to store separate and outside of the CueRide Platform any Confidential Information obtained from the CueRide Platform.

You understand that any violation of the Agreement’s confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or other federal and/or state confidentiality laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to CueRide with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by CueRide or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of CueRide; becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than CueRide without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of CueRide’s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that you shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to CueRide to enable CueRide to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Relationship with CueRide</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">As a Driver on the CueRide Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and CueRide are in a direct business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely that of independent contracting parties. You and CueRide expressly agree that (1) this is not an employment agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and CueRide; and (2) no joint venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind CueRide, and you will not hold yourself out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of CueRide.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">CueRide does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle.

If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data). If you have installed a CueRide Platform device in your vehicle (e.g., a CueRide dashboard device or tablet), that device may similarly collect sensor data and other information like location, as described when you choose and set up such devices. If a Driver chooses to register with CueRide that they use a dashboard recording device, we will receive the information they provide to us about that device (e.g., device serial number).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Communications Between Riders and Drivers. We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications and CueRide Platform chat communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS and chat messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the CueRide Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to grant CueRide access to your contact lists and direct CueRide to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to CueRide. If you choose to do this, we will access the names and contact information of the people in your address book.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Calendar Information. You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant CueRide access to your chosen calendar and direct CueRide to access calendar information, for example to help you get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will access and store information available in your calendar to use in providing you these optional features. CueRide will adhere to the applicable calendar provider policies, including , which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from user’s calendar accounts. You may remove CueRide’s access to your accounts at any time either in-app or through your account provider settings.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies. We collect and use information through the use of “cookies,” tracking pixels, data analytics tools like , SDKs, and other third-party tracking technologies on and off the CueRide Platform to understand how you navigate through the CueRide Platform and interact with advertisements, to make your CueRide experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your experience with us, to serve you or others better ads, and to save your preferences.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Inferences. We may infer certain information from your interactions with the CueRide Platform and other personal information available to us. For example, if you frequently ride to or from airports, we may infer you are a frequent traveler. We may infer your approximate location from your precise location. We may also draw inferences from the information you provide to us, such as inferring your gender based on your first name.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Information We Collect</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Service Providers and Other Parties. Service providers and other parties provide us with information needed for core aspects of the CueRide Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your CueRide experience.

To learn more about your choices regarding marketing and advertising, visit .</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">How We Disclose Your Information</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">We do not sell your personal information to third parties for money -- no one can buy the personal information we collect from and about you and we do not act as a data broker. However, we may need to share your personal information with third parties to deliver relevant personalized ads to you on and off the CueRide Platform. Some of these disclosures may constitute “sharing” or the “sale” of personal information for “targeted advertising” purposes under certain local (e.g., U.S. state) privacy laws, which we describe in more detail . This section otherwise explains when, why, and with whom we disclose your information.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Sharing</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Riders and Drivers.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rider information shared with Driver: As part of surfacing the ride request and enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup and destination, location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns) as well as any additional stops the Rider inputs into the CueRide app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s CueRide profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users when enabling this. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, which may include sharing actual contact information with your consent.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Shared Ride Riders. When Riders use a CueRide shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rides Requested or Paid For by Others. Some rides may be requested or paid for by others. If a ride is requested or taken using a CueRide Business Profile account; a pass, code or coupon; a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit card linked to another account; or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays for or portion of a ride, we may share some or all of that ride’s details with that other party, including rider and driver information (e.g., name, rider phone number), the date, time, charge, region of trip, pick up and drop off location of the ride, feedback and rating regarding the ride, and information related to incidents and accidents that may have occurred.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Linked Accounts and Sharing Upon Your Request. If you use the CueRide Platform as part of a CueRide Family account linked with others or if you direct us to share your information with trusted contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your use of the CueRide Platform, such as the live location of your ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Referral Programs. If you refer someone to the CueRide Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the CueRide Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the CueRide Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">B.
