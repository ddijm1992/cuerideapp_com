This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand how CueRide does that and how to exercise the choices and rights you have in your information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">CueRide’s  provides additional information about our commitment to respecting your personal information, including ways for you to access and delete that information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed"></p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The Scope of This Policy</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This policy applies to all CueRide users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all CueRide platforms and services, including our applications, websites, technology, facilities, and other services (collectively, the “CueRide Platform”). This policy applies only to personal information, not to aggregate information or information that does not identify you. Please remember that your use of the CueRide Platform is also subject to our . Certain elements of the CueRide Platform may operate under separate or additional terms or practices different from or in addition to those described in this policy; in those cases, you will be provided separate notice and information relevant to your use of those parts of the CueRide Platform.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">For users in California, Canada, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia: Additional information regarding CueRide’s privacy practices under jurisdiction-specific privacy laws is available .</p><p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Effective Date: May 30, 2025</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Information We Collect</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">When you use the CueRide Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like service providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">A. Information You Provide to Us</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Your Account. When you create an account with CueRide, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your profile, like saved addresses (e.g., home or work) and gender, and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns). We may ask at the time you set up an account and thereafter that you provide additional information related to the identity of your account, such as documents related to identification (e.g., driver’s license), a profile picture, or “selfie” imagery. If you choose to engage in additional offerings on the CueRide Platform (e.g., linking to other accounts like travel rewards), you may provide us additional information relevant to those offerings.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Driver Information. If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver’s license information (including gender), vehicle information, and car insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and programs relevant to that location.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">User Content. When you rate and provide feedback about the CueRide Platform (including about Riders or Drivers), we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback. When you contact us or we contact you, including through surveys or research projects, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us. Users may choose to send us audio and video content, including in-ride recordings that may be initiated through the CueRide app.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Information We Collect</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Location Information. The CueRide Platform collects location information. This includes approximate and precise location through GPS and WiFi data, IP address, Bluetooth data, and any other location information you choose to share with us. Our processing of this information differs depending on your CueRide app settings, device permissions, and whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the CueRide app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. You may otherwise choose to allow CueRide to collect your device’s precise location if you explicitly grant permission to enable certain products or features. CueRide also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active. If you choose to install a CueRide Platform device in or on your vehicle (e.g., a CueRide dashboard device or a tablet), that device may collect precise location information when turned on.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the CueRide Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. Our e-bikes and scooters may collect mobile sensor data, such as speed, direction, altitude, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data. We also collect information about your interactions with the CueRide Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Device Information. We collect information about the devices you use to access the CueRide Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data). If you have installed a CueRide Platform device in your vehicle (e.g., a CueRide dashboard device or tablet), that device may similarly collect sensor data and other information like location, as described when you choose and set up such devices. If a Driver chooses to register with CueRide that they use a dashboard recording device, we will receive the information they provide to us about that device (e.g., device serial number).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Communications Between Riders and Drivers. We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications and CueRide Platform chat communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS and chat messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the CueRide Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to grant CueRide access to your contact lists and direct CueRide to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to CueRide. If you choose to do this, we will access the names and contact information of the people in your address book.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Calendar Information. You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant CueRide access to your chosen calendar and direct CueRide to access calendar information, for example to help you get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will access and store information available in your calendar to use in providing you these optional features. CueRide will adhere to the applicable calendar provider policies, including , which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from user’s calendar accounts. You may remove CueRide’s access to your accounts at any time either in-app or through your account provider settings.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies. We collect and use information through the use of “cookies,” tracking pixels, data analytics tools like , SDKs, and other third-party tracking technologies on and off the CueRide Platform to understand how you navigate through the CueRide Platform and interact with advertisements, to make your CueRide experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your experience with us, to serve you or others better ads, and to save your preferences.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Inferences. We may infer certain information from your interactions with the CueRide Platform and other personal information available to us. For example, if you frequently ride to or from airports, we may infer you are a frequent traveler. We may infer your approximate location from your precise location. We may also draw inferences from the information you provide to us, such as inferring your gender based on your first name.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Information We Collect</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Service Providers and Other Parties. Service providers and other parties provide us with information needed for core aspects of the CueRide Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your CueRide experience. These service providers and other parties include background check providers, insurance partners, financial service providers, marketing providers, and other businesses. We obtain the following information about you from these parties:</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Information to make the CueRide Platform safer, like background check information or identity verification information;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Information about your participation in third-party programs that provide things like insurance coverage and financial instruments, such as insurance, payment, transaction, and fraud detection information;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Information to operationalize loyalty and promotional/marketing programs or applications, services, or features you choose to connect or link to your CueRide account, such as information about your use of such programs, applications, services, or features; and</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Information about you provided by specific services, such as vehicle, demographic, and other information that helps us provide services or to personalize our marketing.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Enterprise Programs. If you use CueRide through your employer or other organization that participates in one of our CueRide Business enterprise programs, we will collect information about you from those parties, such as your name and contact information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Concierge Service. Sometimes another business or entity may order you a CueRide ride. If an organization has ordered a ride for you using our Concierge service, they will provide us your contact information and the pickup and drop-off location of your ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Referral Programs. If someone refers you to CueRide, we will collect information about you from that referral including your name and contact information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Other Users and Sources. Other users or public or third-party sources such as law enforcement, insurers, media, or pedestrians may provide us information about you, for example as part of an investigation into an incident or to provide you support.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">How We Use</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">If you are a Driver, we may collect and use information related to your sobriety status—such as manual verification entries or integrated tools—strictly to uphold CueRide’s sober driving standards and ensure passenger safety.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">We use your personal information to:</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Provide the CueRide Platform;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Maintain the security and safety of the CueRide Platform and its users;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Build and maintain the CueRide community;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Provide customer support;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Improve the CueRide Platform;</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Respond to legal proceedings and obligations; and</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Provide marketing and advertising.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Providing the CueRide Platform. We use your personal information to provide an intuitive, useful, efficient, and worthwhile experience on our platform.

However, we may need to share your personal information with third parties to deliver relevant personalized ads to you on and off the CueRide Platform. Some of these disclosures may constitute “sharing” or the “sale” of personal information for “targeted advertising” purposes under certain local (e.g., U.S. state) privacy laws, which we describe in more detail . This section otherwise explains when, why, and with whom we disclose your information.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">Sharing</h2><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Riders and Drivers.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rider information shared with Driver: As part of surfacing the ride request and enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup and destination, location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns) as well as any additional stops the Rider inputs into the CueRide app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s CueRide profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users when enabling this. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, which may include sharing actual contact information with your consent.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Shared Ride Riders. When Riders use a CueRide shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Rides Requested or Paid For by Others. Some rides may be requested or paid for by others. If a ride is requested or taken using a CueRide Business Profile account; a pass, code or coupon; a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit card linked to another account; or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays for or portion of a ride, we may share some or all of that ride’s details with that other party, including rider and driver information (e.g., name, rider phone number), the date, time, charge, region of trip, pick up and drop off location of the ride, feedback and rating regarding the ride, and information related to incidents and accidents that may have occurred.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Linked Accounts and Sharing Upon Your Request. If you use the CueRide Platform as part of a CueRide Family account linked with others or if you direct us to share your information with trusted contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your use of the CueRide Platform, such as the live location of your ride.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Referral Programs. If you refer someone to the CueRide Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the CueRide Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the CueRide Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.</p><p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">B.
